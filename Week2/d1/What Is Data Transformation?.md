### Summary of Key Takeaways

- Data transformation is done to not only make data cleaner, but also to make it better structured and organized.
- Properly transformed data can increase the efficiency of the data analysis process, leading to better data-driven decision-making.
- Initial data transformation is focused on shaping the format and structure of the data to ensure compatibility with the existing data in the database.
- Data transformation can also include mapping and translation of data.
- Data transformation is often concerned with consolidating data and making it more manageable, and this can be done by aggregation.
- Data from different sources can be merged to create denormalized, enriched information.
- Data can be transformed so that it's ordered logically or to suit a data storage scheme.
- Data containing personally identifiable information, or other information that could compromise privacy or security, should be anonymized before propagation.
- Many transformations can reshape data without changing content. This includes casting and converting data types for compatibility, adjusting dates and times with offsets and format localization, and renaming schemas, tables, and columns for clarity.

## Conclusion

Data transformation is the process of changing the format, structure, or values of data — all with the goal of making subsequent tasks of data analysis easier. In the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, this is the middle step.
