In the last two readings, we have learned about two libraries used for object serialization in `Python`. Now, it's time to practice the serialization of fitted `Sklearn` models.

## Tutorial

Instruction

Read the article [**Save and Load Machine Learning Models in Python with scikit-learn**](https://machinelearningmastery.com/save-load-machine-learning-models-python-scikit-learn/) and run the code in your own Jupyter notebook. Only complete the section using pickle - you can skip the section on joblib!
