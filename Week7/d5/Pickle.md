## What is Pickling?

**Pickling** is a process where a `Python` object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream and dumped into a file by using the `dump` function. This character stream contains all the information necessary to reconstruct the object in another Python script.

## What is Unpickling?

**Unpickling** is the opposite of the pickling process, where a byte stream is converted into an object hierarchy. While the process of retrieving original Python objects from the stored string representation is called _unpickling_, we use the `load` function to do this.
