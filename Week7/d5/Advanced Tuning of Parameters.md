In this tutorial, we will try building a `Pipeline` and using it to tune hyperparameters with the `Sklearn` library.

## Tutorial

Instruction

Clone [this repo](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/advanced_tuning_of_parameters) and run the notebook.

## Conclusion

We have seen how we can use pipelines to tune parameters and correctly select the right model. In the following section, we will take a look at how to combine different pipelines together.
