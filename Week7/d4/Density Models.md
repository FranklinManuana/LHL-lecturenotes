## What is `DBSCAN`?

`DBSCAN` is a clustering method that is used in machine learning to separate clusters of high density from clusters of low density. It does a great job of seeking areas in data that have a high density of observations, versus areas of the data that are not very dense with observations. `DBSCAN` can sort data into clusters of varying shapes as well.
