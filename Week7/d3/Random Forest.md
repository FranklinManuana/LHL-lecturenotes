## What is Random Forest?

Random Forest is a type of machine learning algorithm that is used for both regression and classification tasks. It is called a "forest" because it consists of many decision trees that work together to make predictions. Each decision tree in the forest is trained on a different subset of the training data, and at each node, the decision tree splits the data based on the most important feature. The feature importance is determined by measuring how much the split improves the performance of the model.

Once all the decision trees have been trained, the Random Forest algorithm combines their predictions to produce a final prediction. This combination of predictions helps to reduce overfitting and improve the accuracy of the model. In simple terms, Random Forest is a powerful machine learning algorithm that uses many decision trees to make accurate predictions.
