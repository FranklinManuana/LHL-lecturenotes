## What is Sampling Bias?

_Sampling bias_ is a bias in which a sample is collected in such a way that some members of the intended population have a lower sampling probability than others. It results in a biased sample, a non-random sample of a population in which all individuals, or instances, were not equally likely to have been selected.

For example, if a survey on a new product is conducted by only asking the customers who were satisfied with the product and ignoring the customers who were dissatisfied, the survey results will be biased and not truly representative of the entire population of customers.
