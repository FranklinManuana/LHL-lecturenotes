Data Optimization is the process of improving data quality. There are different practices to improve data quality, depending on trends the data exhibits. When we fit a line in a linear regression for example, we are optimizing the intercept and the slope. This is one example of optimization. However, we need to approach optimization differently when we work with a logistic regression; a fitted line will not optimize our data in this situation. Gradient descent can optimize data in many different statistics, data science and machine learning situations.

In Machine Learning, we need to optimize a lot of stuff (intercept, slope, clusters...). This is when we call **gradient descent** for help. In the following YouTube video, we will learn how this classic optimization technique works.
