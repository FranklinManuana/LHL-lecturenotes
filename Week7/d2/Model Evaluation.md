## What are Model Evaluation Metrics?

_Model evaluation metrics_ are necessary in order to quantify **model performance**. The choice of _evaluation metrics_ depends on a given machine learning task (such as classification, regression, clustering). Some metrics, such as _precision-recall_, are useful for multiple tasks. Supervised learning tasks, such as classification and regression, constitute the majority of machine learning applications. In this reading, we focus on the metrics for these two supervised learning models.

### Regression Metrics

The most widely used evaluation metrics in regression models are:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE)
- Mean-Absolute-Error (MAE)
- R² or Coefficient of Determination
- Adjusted R²

### Classification Metrics:

The most commonly used evaluation metrics in classification models are:

- Accuracy
- Precision/Recall
- F1-score
- ROC curve/AUC score
- Log-Loss

In the following readings, we will take a closer look at all of the metrics mentioned above.
