## Imbalanced Dataset

An imbalanced dataset refers to a dataset where the number of observations or samples in each class is not evenly distributed. In other words, one class has significantly more or fewer samples than the other classes. For example, a binary classification problem where 90% of the samples belong to class A and only 10% belong to class B is an imbalanced dataset.

Imbalanced datasets are common in real-world applications such as fraud detection, disease diagnosis, and anomaly detection. However, they can pose a challenge for machine learning algorithms as they tend to bias towards the majority class and perform poorly on the minority class. To handle imbalanced datasets, various techniques can be used, such as resampling, cost-sensitive learning, and ensemble methods. Resampling techniques involve either oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class to balance the dataset. Cost-sensitive learning involves assigning different misclassification costs to different classes to account for the imbalance. Ensemble methods combine multiple models trained on different subsets of the data to improve the overall performance.
