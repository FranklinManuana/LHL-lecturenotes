Make sure to read the section in the sidebar _What is data ethics?_

The article suggests some potential ways to avoid data management traps, such as adopting new standards for data management, rethinking governance models, and collaborating across disciplines and organizations. This list of potential challenges and remedies presented is not exhaustive, but what’s clear is that data ethics need more and sustained attention from all members within the organization.

### Reflection Opportunity

To be intentionally mindful of data ethics when working with data, you are encouraged to reflect on the following topics:

- Where did the data you are about to access come from?
    
- Can you make sure people gave their consent to collect their data? For example, when a person subscribes to a newsletter, they opt-in, which is a form of consent. Information on subscribers is then collected and can be used and analyzed for marketing strategies.
    
- Are you about to access personal data? If so, can you tell if the data are private or publicly shared and can actually be used?
