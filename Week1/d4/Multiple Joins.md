### Multiple Joins

Multiple joins involve using multiple tables (at least three) in a query and specifying the relationship between each table using JOIN clauses. This allows for complex queries that involve data from multiple tables, providing a more complete view of the data.

Multiple joins can be achieved using different types of JOIN clauses such as `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN`.

### Ordering JOINS

The process of combining multiple tables in a query can be challenging, and it's important to ensure that the JOIN conditions are specified correctly to produce accurate and meaningful results.

## Conclusion

Multiple joins in SQL refer to the process of combining three or more tables in a single query using JOIN clauses. Having multiple joins can impact the performance of a query in terms of execution time. The order of joins can then matter at this point.
