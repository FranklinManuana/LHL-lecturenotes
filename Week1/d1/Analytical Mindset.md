## Analytical Mindset

In data analysis, it is not the quality or even the quantity of the data that matters most. **It’s what you can do with it.** More specifically, what matters is the insights you can retrieve through analyzing the data, the way you present the insights, and their actionability.

Achieving meaningful insights starts with thinking analytically. Having an analytical mindset is about being driven by curiosity to solve a problem, find answers, and seek new learning opportunities. As long as you bring these traits with you in your journey as a data professional, you will find yourself approaching problems with an analytical mindset.

Note

Reflection is an integral part of the learning process as it provides an opportunity to develop your capacity for metacognition and self-directed learning. Throughout this program, we will provide opportunities to reflect by providing some prompting questions.

#### Conclusion

Having an analytical mindset starts with the desire to understand a problem and find information to answer questions or validate hypotheses.

Data analysis is not just about statistics, calculations, and data visualization. Data analysis is above all the understanding of a problem and its resolution through the use of data with various tools or techniques.

Understand the problem, understand the data, and the rest will follow.
