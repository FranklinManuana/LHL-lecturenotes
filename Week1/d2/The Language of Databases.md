### What is SQL?

SQL is a critical tool for data professionals as it is the most common language for extracting and organizing data that is stored in a relational database.

A database is a table that consists of rows and columns and SQL is the language used to communicate with databases. It facilitates retrieving the specific information from databases that are needed for analysis. Even when the analysis is being done on another platform like Python or R, SQL is needed first to extract data from the database.

### Do I Really Need SQL?

The short answer to this question is: yes. SQL can help you build a foundation for your career in data.

The long answer is more nuanced: how much SQL you need in your day-to-day work ultimately depends on the company you work for and the structure of the data team. Some teams have several Data Engineers and Data Analysts, along with Machine Learning Engineers, while some teams can be composed of just one person who does it all. At the minimum, you will often use SQL to do the following:

- Access data stored in tables to get a useful dataset.
- Quickly discover patterns in data within the database.
- Deliver data products using the most suitable tool (and that is sometimes through SQL queries).

Although other languages are required to discover patterns and build models, a lack of SQL proficiency may block your data process. You’ll need SQL to communicate with the database and work with the data. Many technical interviews for jobs in the world of data test SQL skills in some way, usually with a whiteboard test (i.e., where you solve a problem by writing code on a whiteboard). It goes without saying that it is a worthy investment of your time to acquire solid SQL skills.

### Flavours of SQL

There are different “flavours” of SQL that work with different database engines. For example, PostgreSQL complies as closely as possible with the SQL standard, while other engines use their own variant (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server uses Transact-SQL or T-SQL). Like dialects in a spoken language, these SQL variants occasionally use different words or structures. They can also have additional functionalities that are unique to that variant.

The major flavours of SQL are:

- Oracle
- SQL Server
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL

You will learn more about them in a subsequent reading (Introduction to SQL Envrionments).

### Order of Execution of SQL Queries

The SQL query is not necessarily executed sequentially, line by line. What this means is that the first line of code is not necessarily executed before the second line.

Knowing the order in which an SQL query is executed can help you a great deal in optimizing your queries. Learn more about the Order of SQL Query Executions from a [brief tutorial from Designcise](https://www.designcise.com/web/tutorial/what-is-the-order-of-execution-of-an-sql-query).
