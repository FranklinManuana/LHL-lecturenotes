Hypothesis testing is another crucial part of statistics in data science. There are many cases where we need hypothesis tests in data science and machine learning, including:

- Testing the significance of regression coefficients
- Testing the relationship between two categorical variables
- Testing if the distribution is normal and if we can use various prediction techniques
- and many more...

### What is Statistical Hypothesis Testing?

_A hypothesis test_ is a statistical test that is used to determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample of data to infer that a certain condition is true for the entire population.

_A hypothesis test_ examines two opposing hypotheses about a population: **the null hypothesis** and **the alternative hypothesis**.

- `Null hypothesis` (**H0**): _The null hypothesis_ states that a population parameter is equal to a certain value. _The null hypothesis_ is often the initial claim that researchers specify using previous research or knowledge.
    
- `Alternative Hypothesis` (**H1**): _The alternative hypothesis_ states that the population parameter is different than the value of the population parameter in the null hypothesis. _The alternative hypothesis_ is what we might believe to be true or hope to prove true.
    

Based on sample data, the test determines whether to reject _the null hypothesis_.

That was fast right :)

We are using p-values to determine whether to reject or not the null hypothesis. We can find more information about p-values in the following video.
