The central limit theorem is often considered **the most important** theorem in Data Science. Obviously, this is debatable, but what isn't debatable is that it's a **very important** one.

The essential concept of _the central limit theorem_ is that the average of our samples' means will be the population mean. In other words, if we add up the means from all of our samples and find the average, that average will be our actual population mean. Similarly, if we find the average of the standard deviations of our samples, we will find the actual standard deviation for our population. It is a pretty useful phenomenon that can help us accurately predict the characteristics of a population.
