### Clean vs Dirty Data

In the previous activities, we mostly started with data that had already been cleaned. This is common in a learning environment, but not a true reflection of how you will come across data in the real world. Strategizing how you will clean your data and implementing best practices around data cleaning will allow you to avoid issues that can arise when you miss that step.

### What happens when you don’t clean data?

Sometimes data cleaning can seem tedious and time-consuming. In fact, depending on the nature of the data set, the data cleaning process can often take up a large portion of your total time spent on a particular project. However, it truly is a necessary step in the analysis process. Here are some things that can go wrong if you don’t clean your data!

Depending on the state of the uncleaned data, it might prevent you from performing sufficient exploration on the data set. Depending on the data set and the cleaning steps missed, you might not be able to get an accurate summary or descriptive statistics on the data. Dirty data will give lead analysts to the wrong conclusion. Dirty data will prevent your statistical or machine learning models from performing well.
