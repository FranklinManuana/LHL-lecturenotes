We will take a closer look at the three most important types of tests:

- One-sample t-test
- Chi-Squared test
- One-Way ANOVA

### One-sample t-test

The one-sample t-test is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether an unknown population mean is different from a specific value.

### Chi-squared test

## Conclusion

We have taken a look at the most often used hypothesis tests. It's not possible to cover all of them but the idea is very similar. The trickiest part is to select the right test which is correct for that type of problem.
