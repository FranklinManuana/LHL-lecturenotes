In this activity, we will go over the logistic regression output we generated in the previous activity:

First, let’s go over some terminology in the table:

### Understanding the Model Output

In the model output above, you should pay attention to the following statistics in this order: 1. **Log-Likelihood :** the natural logarithm of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) function. MLE is the optimization process of finding the set of parameters that result in the best fit. 2. **LL-Null :** the value of log-likelihood of the model when no independent variable is included(only an intercept is included). 3. **P>|z| (or the p-value)**: A p-value of less than 0.05 is considered to be statistically significant. 4. **coef :** the coefficients of the independent variables in the regression equation.

#### Log - Likelihood

Notice that the value for `Method` in the top left part of the output is `MLE`. This stands for **maximum likelihood estimation.**

Now, direct your attention to the right part of the output that reads `Log-Likelihood`. The likelihood function can be summarized as the probability that the observed data were generated by a given set of _parameter values_ (i.e., values for the intercept and regression weight(s)). Here, our goal is to find the parameter values that _maximize_ the likelihood function, hence, the term “maximum likelihood”.

In practice, it is preferable to calculate the natural logarithm of the likelihood — that is, the **log-likelihood** — as the log-likelihood is [simpler to differentiate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SYMv2uEDfQTr3MI2jTDFviC4xsQ2-pKt/view?usp=drive_link) compared to the likelihood. Where _p_ represents the predicted probability of belonging to a class of interest in a binary outcome (e.g., class 1 or class 0) for a given observation, _i_, and _y_ represents the observation’s actual value, the log-likelihood can be written as follows:

The log-likelihood of our model is -321.37.

#### LL-Null

The “null” model, which is the model with the intercept as the only parameter, has a log-likelihood of -480.45, as shown in the `LL-Null` output below the `Log-Likelihood`.

The `LLR p-value` provides the p-value from a **[likelihood-ratio test](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faqhow-are-the-likelihood-ratio-wald-and-lagrange-multiplier-score-tests-different-andor-similar/)** of the model at hand versus the null model. If this p-value meets an established threshold for statistical significance, then we can conclude that the model fits the data better than the null model. In this case, the results of the likelihood-ratio test indicate that including sex, embark-town, age, and pclass as predictors of survival significantly improves model fit, compared to the intercept-only null model.

#### p-value

The value of 0.000 in the `P>|z|` column for the `sex[T.male]` row shows that the effect of sex on survival outcome is statistically significant at conventional levels of significance. Thus, we can have confidence that the relationship between survival or not and sex in this dataset is unlikely to be solely attributable to [sampling error](https://methods.sagepub.com/Reference/encyc-of-research-design/n401.xml). The values in the `[0.025` and `0.075]` columns provide the 95% [confidence interval](https://stattrek.com/estimation/confidence-interval) for the weight for sex, respectively. The fact that 0 does not fall inside the 95% confidence interval for sex also tells us that the effect of sex on survival in this model is [statistically significant](https://blog.minitab.com/en/adventures-in-statistics-2/understanding-hypothesis-tests-confidence-intervals-and-confidence-levels), at the 5% level of significance.

#### coef

Now let’s focus on the intercept and regression weight results at the bottom of the table. Under the `coef` column, the `Intercept` row has a value of 5.2698. This means that when all the other explanatory variables are 0, the predicted log-odds of having a value of 1 on Outcome (i.e, being classified as survived) is 5.2698. The value of -2.5187 for `sex[T.male]` in the `coef` column means that being a man decreases the value of odds of surviving. The other coefficients can be interpreted in a similar way
