In this course, we will focus on the following two regression algorithms:

- **Simple Linear Regression**: This type is the least complicated form of regression, where there is a single independent variable that is continuous.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: This is an extension of simple linear regression, where there are at least two continuous independent variables.

### Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression is the most straightforward form of a regression model. There is a single continuous independent variable that is used to predict a dependent variable.

For example, suppose we had access to a housing dataset with only 2 columns: square footage and projected house value. In this case, we could build a simple linear regression model using square footage as our independent variable, x, to predict the projected house value, y.

### Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between multiple independent variables and one dependent variable.

For example, suppose our housing dataset now has the following columns: square footage, number of bathrooms, lot size, distance to schools and projected home value. In this case, we can build a multiple linear regression model using square footage, the number of bathrooms, lot size, and distance to schools as independent variables to predict the projected home value.
