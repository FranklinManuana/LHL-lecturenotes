## Regression vs. Classification

Classification and regression algorithms can both be used for forecasting in statistics (as well as in machine learning) and operate with labelled datasets.

The key distinction between classification and regression algorithms is that regression algorithms are used to determine continuous values such as price, income, age, etc. whereas classification algorithms are used to forecast or classify distinct values such as true or false, spam or not spam, etc.

### Regression

Regression is the method of discovering a function or a model so that we can understand the correlation between a dependent and an independent variable. Regression algorithms help predict continuous variables such as house prices, market trends, weather patterns, oil and gas prices, etc.

The regression algorithm’s task is to find the function that lets us map the input variable of “x” to the continuous output variable of “y.”

Here are a few of the most common regression algorithms:

- Simple Linear Regression
- Multivariate Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression

Note

There is a fine line between statistical modelling and machine learning and regression algorithms exist in both fields. During this course, our focus will be on regression models in the context of statistical modelling only, so we will be covering simple and multivariate linear regression.

### Classification

On the other hand, classification is an algorithm that finds functions that help divide the dataset into classes based on various parameters.

Classification algorithms find the mapping function to map the “x” input to “y”, the discrete output . The algorithms estimate discrete values (in other words, binary values such as 0 and 1, yes and no, true or false) based on a particular set of independent variables. To put it another way, classification algorithms predict an event occurrence probability by fitting data to function.

Classification algorithms are used for things like email and spam classification, predicting the willingness of bank customers to pay their loans, and identifying cancer tumour cells.

Here are a few of the most common classification algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- Multinomial logistic regression
- GLM
- K-Nearest Neighbours
- Support Vector Machines
- Kernel SVM
- Naïve Bayes
- Decision Tree Classification
- Random Forest Classification

Note

There is a fine line between statistical modelling and machine learning and classification algorithms exist in both fields. During this course, our focus will be on classification models in the context of statistical modelling only, so we will be covering logistic, multinomial and GLM.
