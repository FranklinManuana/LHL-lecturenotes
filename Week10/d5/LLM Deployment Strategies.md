## Introduction

Now that you have understood the basics of deploying an LLM, it’s time to think about how you plan to deploy your project's LLM model. In this task, you will brainstorm with your peers different deployment strategies and scenarios for deploying your LLM model.

## Instructions

Go to the Discord channel and discuss with your peers:

- What steps would you take to deploy your model?

Note

The reading you completed earlier ([Best Practices for Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in Production](https://medium.com/@_aigeek/best-practices-for-deploying-large-language-models-llms-in-production-fdc5bf240d6a)), or further Google research may help you gauge your deployment steps.

- What specific tools/processes would you adopt/utilize to plan the deployment?
    
- What does the deployment process look like in a production environment?
    
- What would be your considerations and concerns around the deployment process?
    

Instruction

Give and receive feedback, ideas, and suggestions on LLM model deployment to/from your peers.

Note

**Note on LLM Model Deployment**: You are not expected to deploy the fine-tuned LLM as part of the project work; it's optional. However, you are encouraged to deploy it and test it for your own learning. In any case, record the deployment steps for your future reference.
