## Introduction

Congratulations, you are approaching the end of the LLM course. However, you may still want to continue your learning streak after this course. Do you wonder how to keep updated with the constantly evolving LLM landscape? In this reading, you will find valuable suggestions and resources that will help you stay well-informed of all the latest developments in LLMs.

## Reading

Staying updated with the latest developments in the field of LLMs involves a multifaceted approach. Here are some of the ways you can keep working on your LLM knowledge and skills:

### Newsletters

Note

**Subscribe to Newsletters**: Newsletters are a fantastic way to soak in all the LLM knowledge at your pace. You may subscribe to the following newsletters for the continuous stream of knowledge:

- **NVIDIA**: This [newsletter by NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/large-language-model-news/) covers a range of AI topics, including developments in LLMs. It's known for its in-depth analysis and industry insights.
    
- **IEEE Spectrum**: IEEE issues a newsletter ([IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/large-language-models)) that provides LLM news, resources, and inspirations, often including updates and articles related to the latest development in the field of LLMs.
    
- **The Batch by Andrew Ng**: Curated by AI pioneer Andrew Ng, [The Batch](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/) provides weekly updates on the latest AI news and research, often including updates on LLMs.
    

### Online LLM Courses & Workshops

- **Cohere LLM University**: [LLM University by Cohere](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/llmu) provides a great course and resources for learning about NLP and LLMs.
    
- **Hugging Face**: Hugging Face also offers a [free course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1) that teaches how to use their libraries and tools for building and deploying state-of-the-art language models.
    
- **Coursera**: There are [several courses on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=large%20language%20models) focusing on NLP and LLMs. These courses often include practical projects and are suitable for learners of various levels.
    

Note

**Pace Your Learning**: Since you have already been on an intensive learning curve for a while in the bootcamp, it is highly recommended to slow down a bit and pace yourself if you plan to take any of these courses next. Two to three hours of learning on a weekly basis is more than good.

### YouTube Community

Note

**Learning on YouTube**: If YouTube is your alternate learning platform, then stream some of the videos from these channels/podcasts popular for their NLP and LLM content.

- **[Hugging Face](https://www.youtube.com/@HuggingFace)**: Known for their work in NLP and LLMs, Hugging Face shares educational content and discussions about their projects and AI research.
    
- **[DeepMind](https://www.youtube.com/@Google_DeepMind)**: The official channel of DeepMind where they post videos about their latest research and developments, including work on AI and language models.
    
- **[OpenAI](https://www.youtube.com/@OpenAI)**: OpenAI occasionally posts videos that showcase their research and advancements in AI, including their work on language models like GPT-3.
    

### Continued Learning – Best Practices

- **Always Take Notes**: As you watch/listen to the LLM videos and podcasts on YouTube, don’t forget to take notes for future reference.
    
- **Create Knowledge Journal**: Create a knowledge journal to record the key learnings as you consume the resources mentioned on this page. The journal could be as simple as a [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/product/docs), a Google Doc, or even a physical journal if that’s what works for you.
    
- **Learn by Doing**: Aim to implement what you are learning from the listed resources through personal projects within your areas of interest. Developing end-to-end projects serves two major purposes:
    
    - Solidifies learning and understanding
    - Enhances your portfolio for showcasing to potential employers

Note

Remember to host your work on GitHub using best coding practices. Also, include your best work in your professional portfolio.
