With what we've learned by now, we are going to create our first `Flask` application. The only purpose of this application is to display `Hello World`.

Instruction

Follow the steps in the PDF copy of this Medium tutorial called [Building a Python Flask application — Tutorial 01](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WXLslg_2P3fAf9Knz1V8YjiZuWSQfcDB/view?usp=drive_link). This time choose the IDE most suitable for you (preferably VSCode).

Note

Follow along only until the section where PyCharm is installed. We don't need to repeat the tasks in Pycharm.

Note

This walkthrough uses `venv` to manage virtual environments, but so far in the program we've been using `conda`.

We can either skip the section of this walkthrough where a virtual environment is created (just using our already-made bootcamp environment), or create an environment for this walkthrough using `conda create --name ENV-NAME python=3.9`.
