Welcome to this XGBoost classification walkthrough, where we will be exploring one of the most popular machine learning algorithms used in the field of data science.

In this walkthrough, you will be exploring the basic concepts of XGBoost classification and demonstrating its implementation step-by-step using Python. You will cover key topics such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. By the end of this walkthrough, you will have a solid understanding of how to prepare data and train your model, as well as make predictions.

So, let's get started!
