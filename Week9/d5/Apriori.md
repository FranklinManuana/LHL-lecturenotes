Next, you will dive into clustering techniques. Clustering techniques are an important part of unsupervised learning in data science. They are used to identify groups or clusters within a dataset based on similarity or distance measures between data points. Some popular clustering techniques include Apriori, which is used for association rule mining and market basket analysis, and Topic Modeling, which is used to discover hidden topics within a corpus of documents. These techniques are important because they allow us to gain insights into complex data structures and identify patterns that may not be immediately apparent. Clustering can be used in a wide range of applications, such as customer segmentation, image segmentation, and text analysis, to name a few. By understanding and utilizing clustering techniques, data scientists can uncover valuable insights and make data-driven decisions that improve the performance of a business or organization.

This reading will introduce the interesting algorithm called `Apriori`.
