Welcome to this walkthrough on Multi-class Classification with XGBoost! As you just read, Multi-class classification is an important problem in machine learning where we aim to predict a target variable that can take on more than two discrete values. XGBoost is a popular algorithm that can handle multi-class classification problems with high accuracy and efficiency.

In this walkthrough, you will explore the key concepts of multi-class classification and demonstrate the implementation of XGBoost for this task step-by-step using Python.
