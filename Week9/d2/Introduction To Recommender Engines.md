In this reading, we will learn about `Recommender Engines`, which belong to another branch of machine learning algorithms.

## What are `Recommender Engines`?

Often termed also as `Recommender Systems`, they are simple algorithms that aim to provide the most relevant and accurate items to the user by filtering useful stuff from a huge pool of information base. _Recommendation engines_ discover patterns in a dataset by learning consumers' choices and produce outcomes that co-relate to their needs and interests.

Some examples of _recommendation engine_ usage can be found in the following applications:

- Facebook: “People You May Know”
- Netflix: “Other Movies You May Enjoy”
- LinkedIn: “Jobs You May Be Interested In”
- Amazon: “Customer who bought this item also bought …”
- Google: “Visually Similar Images”
- YouTube: “Recommended Videos”
- Waze: “Best Route”
