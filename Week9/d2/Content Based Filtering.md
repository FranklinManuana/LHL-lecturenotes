After a short intro and motivation, we will begin our journey to mastering `Recommender Engines` with `Content-based filtering` models. We will also learn how `NLP` can be useful in this type of models.

## Content-Based Filtering

We will stay with movies for now and take a look at **content-based recommender engines**.

Instruction

Read the PDF copy of this Towards Data Science article called [How to build a content-based movie recommender system with Natural Language Processing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mVQ5qOMOzmrXn2tsEaPQOaZWboMj8W4E/view?usp=drive_link) to learn more about _content-based filtering_.

## Conclusion

As we could see in this reading, this is no rocket science. _Content-based algorithms_ recommend movies and items based on their content. Who would say, right? :) The biggest takeaway from the article should be the difference between _content-based_ vs. _collaborative-filtering-based_ algorithms. We will talk about the latter more later.
