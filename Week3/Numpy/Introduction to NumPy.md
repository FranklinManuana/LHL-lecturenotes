_NumPy_ is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Some of the things it contains, such as the things mentioned below which are a bit abstract, are good to become gradually familiar with:

1. A powerful N-dimensional array object
2. Sophisticated broadcasting functions
3. Useful linear algebra and random number capabilities

Of the many reasons we should use _NumPy_ the speed of execution and the size of stored objects are the two that are most important to us.
