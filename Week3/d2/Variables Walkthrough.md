There are some rules about what can and cannot be a variable. In this activity, we are going to practice assigning variables in Python.

Instruction

Follow this [tutorial by Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-variables/) - we encourage you to type out the commands into your notebook and play around with them.

Take your time and make sure you master how to define and manipulate variables.

Note

Once we know how to create variables, and how they can be made to reference various objects, we can move on to work with strings of text. Everything connects together!
