In this activity, we are going to practice using operations with numbers. These operations are quite straightforward because addition is addition no matter which programming language we use. The same goes for other operations commonly used with numbers.

Instruction

Although you're already familiar with some basic mathematical operations such as addition and multiplication, there are a couple more important ones to know. Follow this [simple tutorial put together by Coding Explained](https://codingexplained.com/coding/python/basic-math-operators-in-python). As always, we encourage you to type out the commands into your notebook to get hands-on practice.

Note

There are a couple of important things we need to focus on and they are clearly explained in the tutorial. However, we want to point out one thing: sometimes, these operations change a type of number from `int` to `float`, which can cause some unexpected issues.
