## Commonly Used Python Libraries

A Python library is a collection of related modules and functions. It contains packages of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs, making Python programming simpler and convenient for the programmer.

Often, a particular Python library will have a main focus, such as manipulating data or creating data visualizations.

The Anaconda distribution already has many of the most important libraries built in. This activity gives you a survey of the most commonly used Python libraries. Throughout your learning journey in this program you will likely use many of the libraries listed below.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation Libraries

The following libraries are used primarily for for data cleaning and data transformations.

#### Pandas

Pandas is widely used as a tool for data cleaning, data wrangling and data analysis. Pandas was first developed at AQR Capital Management and in late 2009 became an open source project. Apart from being used for data analysis, Pandas is also a powerful and flexible data manipulation tool.

There are a few more things you should know about Ppandas. Similar to Numpy, Pandas is fast - because it is built in C or Cython. It has many functions to manipulate data such as integrated indexing, handling missing values, being able to read various file formats, aggregating or transforming data, and more. As a result, Pandas is used in various domains such as academic, commercial, economics, statistics, and of course data analytics and science.

You can explore more about Pandas by checking out the [material provided on the Pandas website](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

#### NumPy

NumPy is the Python library for scientific computing and data science. It was created in 2005 and is a 100% open-source software released under the BSD license. NumPy is also used as the foundation for several other python libraries, such as Scikit-learn, SciPy, and more. There are several reasons why NumPy is inseparable from the field of data science. First, NumPy has a very fast computing performance because NumPy’s core is well-optimized C code. Second, NumPy has a concise syntax that is easy for beginners to read and use. It also has many functions that support scientific computing such as random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more. Finally, NumPy has a powerful n-dimensional array that is operable on GPU and sparse array libraries.

#### BeautifulSoup

BeautifulSoup is another really popular library for web crawling and data scraping. If you want to collect data that’s available on some website but not via a proper CSV or API, BeautifulSoup can help you scrape it and arrange it into the format you need.

#### SciPy

SciPy has many algorithms for scientific computing, and is widely used in optimization, algebraic equations, differential equations, etc. Just like NumPy and Ppandas, SciPy is built using low-level languages such as Fortran, C, and C++ so it has very fast computing performance.

### Data Visualization Libraries

These libraries are used to create data visualizations.

#### Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a core plotting package for Python. Many other Python plotting packages are integrated with Matplotlib.

You can read more about Matplotlib by exploring [the content on the Matplotlib website](https://matplotlib.org/stable/)

#### Seaborn

Seaborn is based on Matplotlib.

#### Plotly

This is a web-based tool for data visualization that offers many useful out-of-box graphics. You can find out more about them on the [Plotly website](https://plotly.com/). The library works very well in interactive web applications. Its creators are busy expanding the library with new graphics and features for supporting multiple linked views, animation, and crosstalk integration.

#### Streamlit

Streamlit is a Python library that allows you to quickly create and share beautiful custom web applications for data science. Streamlit was launched in 2018 by Adrien Treuille, Amanda Kelly, and Thiago Teixeira, and it has a growing community. Streamlit has the ability to display and organize data, draw charts, draw maps, add interactive widgets, customize app layouts, calculate cache, define custom themes, and there is Streamlit cloud.

### Machine Learning Libraries

This course does not cover machine learning, however it might be useful for you to begin to gain some awareness of the Python libraries used for machine learning purposes.

#### Scikit-learn

It might be nearly impossible for a data professional to avoid Scikit-learn (also known as sklearn). It is a very popular Python toolkit for machine learning tasks, and it has consistent syntax and excellent documentation. This makes Scikit-learn very popular for machine learning tasks because it has many features such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, model selection-evaluation, dataset transformations, dataset loading utilities, and more. If you want to explore more about Scikit-learn, be sure to check out [the resources provided](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) on their website.

#### TensorFlow and Keras

Tensorflow shines in deep learning tasks in machine learning. TensorFlow is a library developed by the Google brain team and was first released in 2015 under the Apache 2.0 license. Besides being able to be used in the Python programming language, TensorFlow can also be used with the JavaScript, C++, and Java programming languages.

TensorFlow has several features that make it popular among academics. When combined with Keras, it provides a high-level API that is easier to use and powerful. TensorFlow provides flexibility and control with features such as the Keras Functional API and the Model Subclassing API for building complex topologies.

#### PyTorch

PyTorch is an alternative to TensorFlow in machine learning and deep learning tasks, and was developed by Facebook’s AI Research lab (FAIR) and was first released in September 2016 under the BSD license. Python is built with Python, C++, and CUDA programming languages. Unlike TensorFlow, PyTorch is more popular in industrial and commercial circles. PyTorch also has many features, including fast, flexible experimentation, efficient production through a user-friendly front-end, distributed training, and being well-supported on major cloud platforms.

## Conclusion

As you can see, there is a long list of Python libraries and each is suited to a particular task or set of tasks you would like to accomplish with your data. As a data professional you will need to identify which library is the best choice for the tasks you want to execute.
