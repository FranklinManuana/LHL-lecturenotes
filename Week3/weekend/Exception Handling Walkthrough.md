## Exception Handling

In the previous activity, we got familiar with the types of errors in `Python`. Now, we will learn how to catch these errors and manipulate them, so that the code can run even with the errors. This can be quite useful, but we have to proceed with caution as it can cause us a lot of trouble in debugging if we don't do it right.
