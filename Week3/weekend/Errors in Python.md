## Errors in Python

_"To err is human"_ and since data scientists are also only humans, we're going to take a look at the types of errors in `Python`.

It is important to recognize and get comfortable with Python errors as errors help us understand where the problem lies. There's no need to panic when we see one (or more) during the first run of your code, it happens more often than you would think.

Learning the basics of different error types in Python will allow you to have a better idea of what went wrong when you come across one.

Instruction

Read the article [**Python - Error Types**](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/error-types-in-python) and focus on different types of errors.

Note

Sometimes, we want our code to continue running even when an error occurs but we'll jump more into this next.
