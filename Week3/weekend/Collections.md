## Collections

So far we have focused on `Python` built-in container data types (lists, sets, tuples, dictionary). In addition to these, Python has a module named `collections` which has special data structures.

### Collections module

The `collections` module provides high-performance data types that can enhance our code, making things much cleaner and easier. In this reading, we will look in detail at four of the most common Python collections along with their usage.

### Key Takeaways

A container is an object that is used to store different objects and provides a way to access the contained objects and iterate over them. Python’s `collections` module implements some very useful and specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Python’s general purpose built-in containers: dict, list, set, and tuple.
