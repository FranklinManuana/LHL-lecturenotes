In this activity we will get to know our first Python **control structure**: the **if** statement.

Up until this point, the Python code we have written had sequential execution. That means that the lines of code were executed one after another.

However, real life is often more complicated. Many times, we need to skip over some lines, execute a series of statements more than once, or choose between alternate sets of statements.

That is where _control structures_ come in. _A control structure_ directs the order of the execution of statements in a program (referred to as the program’s **control flow**).

> #### Reflection Opportunity
> 
> Choosing suitable variable names will often help to make your code much easier to read, and this is especially true within a Python control flow structure.
> 
> In a control flow structure, variable names can help to clarify the purpose and behaviour of different parts of the code. For example, in a loop, using a variable name that clearly indicates the purpose of the loop, such as "counter", can make it easier to understand how the loop is functioning. Similarly, in an if-else statement, using variable names that reflect the conditions being tested can make it easier to understand the logic of the code.
> 
> In Python, using descriptive variable names can also help to make the code self-documenting, which means that the code itself provides enough information to understand its purpose and behaviour without requiring additional comments. This can be especially helpful for other developers who may need to modify or maintain the code in the future.
> 
> In summary, choosing suitable variable names can be a simple and effective way to improve the readability and maintainability of your code, especially within control flow structures.
