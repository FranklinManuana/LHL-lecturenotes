## Control Structures

We've now learned _the basic data types_ and what type of information we can store in Python _variables_. Also, we now know how _control structures_ can alter the execution of code so that it doesn't run everything from top to bottom in the file only once.

In this activity, we will continue to practice working with control structures some more. The goal is to get as comfortable as possible with these concepts!

Instruction

> #### Reflection Opportunity
> 
> Review your own code after you have completed the activity. Have you named all of your variables in a clear and concise way so that they help in explaining your code?
