In this activity, we'll explain what the **Anaconda distribution** of Python is and why we chose it for this bootcamp.

Application through practice is an integral part of the learning process when it comes to coding. By working on projects and writing code, you can gain a deeper understanding of the concepts and become more proficient in the language. The practice of coding also builds your problem-solving capabilities, a key competency of a data professional.

So where can you practice writing Python code?

This brings us to the coding environment. A coding environment is a combination of software applications that provide a set of tools and features to help write, test and debug code.

We will start with installing Anaconda.

Anaconda is a distribution of Python that includes commonly used libraries and tools for data wrangling, analysis, and modeling, such as Numpy, and Pandas. In addition, it has a package manager called Conda that makes it easy to install and manage additional libraries. By installing Anaconda, you can have all of these tools and libraries pre-installed and ready to use, which can save you time and effort when setting up your development environment.

Additionally, Anaconda allows you to create isolated environments for different projects, which can help you manage dependencies and avoid conflicts. This will come in handy as you experiment with personal projects outside of the bootcamp to build your portfolio and find your area of interest.

Instruction

Visit [**the Anaconda webpage**](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to find some basic information about the distibution.

Keep in mind that _Anaconda_ is NOT a replacement for classic Python. _Anaconda_ is only a distribution of Python (i.e., something like a collection of programs that allow you to use Python).

Note

Feel free to read this thread on stackoverflow on [How is Anaconda related to Python?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42096280/how-is-anaconda-related-to-python).

## Conclusion

We've seen that the most important difference between _Anaconda_ and Python is that _Anaconda_ is a Python and R distribution for data science and machine learning, while Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Now that we know this, we can move to the next step: the installation.
