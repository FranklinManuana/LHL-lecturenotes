When learning a new programming language, a lot of your time is spent on understanding the syntax, logic as well as built-in features and functionality. However, there is also something else you will need to learn— apart from the language itself and that is the tools and applications that, together with the Python language, form a Data Environment. Sometimes data professionals will refer to this as a Python Environment. An understanding of this environment will help you boost your efficiency in learning and enhance your productivity every day.

Each data analyst and data scientist might have a slightly different combination of Python environment that they use every day. This is because there are a number of choices everyone must make when building their Python environment. In addition, as you become more experienced and take on more responsibility, the data environment you need and prefer will change, evolving with your abilities. This activity introduces the various basic components of a data environment.

### Components of a Data Environment in Python

1. Shells
2. Terminal
3. Python version managament
4. Python package management
5. Python interpreters (IDEs)
6. Virtual Environments
7. Text editors
8. Git and Github

#### Shells

Common examples of shells are Command Prompt (Windows), zsh (MacOS), and BASH. The shell is a framework that you can use to build an ecosystem for your coding environment that will speed up your workflow and help you focus on your analytical tasks.

#### Terminal Emulators

Whereas a shell provides a CLI (command-line interface) tool, a terminal is a graphical interface which you use to access the shell. Common examples of terminal emulators (terminals) are Command Prompt and Cygwin (Windows) and Terminal (MacOS).

#### Python Version Management

As a data professional, you will find situations where you need to configure your Python environment in a specific way — possibly because different projects require different Python versions, or you might be developing a code project that needs to work in several different versions.

The most common tools used to manage Python environments are conda and pipenv. Read more about Python version management on the [real Python website](https://realpython.com/effective-python-environment/#python-version-management).

#### Python Package Managers

Package Manager is a tool that allows you to manage the dependencies (this means another package is required before you can use a particular package) for your project that is not part of the standard Python libraries.

Managing all these dependencies can be hard because packages may require specific versions of their dependencies. Common Python package managers are pip (the standard package manager for Python) or conda (the package manager for Anaconda).

#### Python Interpreters (IDE)

An Integrated Development Environment is a software package that developers use to create programs. It’s meant to maximize a programmer’s productivity by incorporating closely related components with simple user interfaces. Essentially, it’s a tool that improves the process of creating, testing, and debugging source code — it makes the job easier.

#### Virtual Environments

Often, you’ll be working on multiple projects that need the _same_ Python version. However, different projects will have their own set of dependencies, so it’s a good practice to avoid mixing them up. If all the dependencies are installed together in a single Python environment, then it will be difficult to discern where each one came from. Furthermore, two different projects may depend on two different versions of a package, but with Python, you can only have one version of a package installed at one time.

In practice, we solve this problem by using virtual environments. Read more about virtual environments on the [real Python website](https://realpython.com/effective-python-environment/#virtual-environments).

#### Text Editors

The main point of difference between a text editor and other applications that allow you to edit text is that a text editor does not save formatting. So, it is possible to find a text editor with thousands of features, just like a word processor. The defining characteristic is that it saves the text as simple, plain text.

## Conclusion

Getting comfortable with all the tools needed to set up a data environment will take some time. As you progress in your learning and experience you may develop personal preferences that you will have to reconcile with what the project requires!
