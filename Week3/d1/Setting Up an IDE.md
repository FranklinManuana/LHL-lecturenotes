## Setting up an IDE

We can write and edit Python scripts in any text editor, even Notepad or VIM. However, an IDE (integrated development environment) is a tool that allows us to structure our code, help us debug, and use multiple languages in one place.

### Different IDEs

There are several popular IDEs for working with data, including:

- Jupyter Notebook (also Jupyter Lab)
- VSCode
- PyCharm

In this activity, we will look at how we can work with VSCode.

VSCode, or Visual Studio Code, is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle.

### Setting up VSCode for Python

Instruction

Install VSCode on your computer [**from visual studio**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

Note

If you have a Mac with Apple Silicon (M1), make sure to click on the Apple Silicon version and not on the big blue button.

### Install Extensions

Once you have installed VSCode, there are still three extensions that you should install: Jupyter, Python and SQLite.

#### Jupyter Extension

Inside VSCode, navigate to and click on the Extension icon:

In the search bar on top, type “jupyter”, and select the Jupyter extension from Microsoft, and click “Install”:

#### Python Extension

In the search bar on top, type “python”, and select the Python extension from Microsoft, and click “Install”:

In addition, before running either a Jupyter notebook or a Python file, be sure to check that you are indeed using the correct version of Python. To check this, look at the top-right corner of your VSCode. In this case, the default version being used is Python 3.8.9:

Click on the version to toggle and select the correct version of Python. In this case, we chose Python 3.9.7

#### SQLIte Extension

We also need to install the SQLite extension package from 'alexcvzz': ![sqlite extension](https://i.imgur.com/grBLWLV.png)
