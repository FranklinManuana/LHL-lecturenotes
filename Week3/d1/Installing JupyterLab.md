In the default Anaconda Distribution, _Jupyter_ is already pre-installed. Therefore, we can simply start it.

### Starting the JupyterLab

Note

If you are using Linux or a Mac you can find your terminal in your list of applications, or you can simply type "Terminal" into your search bar. If you are using a Windows machine, search for "Anaconda prompt".

Instruction

Use Terminal and write the command below to start `Jupyter Lab`.

```shell
jupyter lab
```

This will start a webserver on your local machine and open a window in your browser automatically. It will run on `http://localhost:8888/lab`.
