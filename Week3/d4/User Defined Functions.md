We already know the data types we can use in Python and how to control the flow of the code execution. Now it's time we take a look at **user defined functions**.

_A user defined function_ is a programmed function that has its parameters set by the user of the system. _User defined functions_ are often seen as programming shortcuts, as they define functions that perform specific tasks within a larger system. They serve to extend functionalities of programming software that are not available through the built-in functions.

Instruction

Start your own notebook and follow along with the video below to learn the most important things about _user defined functions_ in Python.

> #### Reflection Opportunity
> 
> Have you noticed, from the video, that we have respected some of the basic best practices for writing user-defined functions in programming:
> 
> - Use descriptive and meaningful function names: The name of a function should clearly indicate its purpose and behaviour.
>     
> - Use clear and concise function signatures: A function's signature, or its input and output parameters, should be clear and easy to understand.
>     
> - Use meaningful and descriptive variable names within the function: The variable names used within a function should be clear and easy to understand, and should accurately reflect their purpose or value.
>     
> - Limit the function's responsibility: A function should have a single, well-defined purpose and should not be responsible for multiple tasks or operations.
>     
> - Use meaningful return values: Functions should return meaningful values that accurately reflect their purpose or behaviour.
>     
> 
> Adhering to these best practices can make functions more readable, maintainable, and easy to understand.
> 
> **What systems can you put in place for yourself so that implementing these best practices in your code can become second nature?**
