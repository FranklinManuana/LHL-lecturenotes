One of the data types we still need to cover is **Sets**.

_Sets_ are used less often than Lists or Dictionaries but can be very handy in data analytics. Imagine that you want to store the values which can be stored in a table. _Set_ is the right data type to choose for this because you can be sure that each value is going to be present only once.

You may recall learning about _sets_ sometime in the past during your math lectures. If not, never mind, because we are going to review everything and explore how we can work with _sets_ in Python.

Instruction

Start your own notebook and follow this [**Sets in Python** tutorial by Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-sets/) to learn how to work with sets in Python.

> How well are the variables named in this activity? Are they clear to you? Are they self-explanatory? What improvements would you have made in variable naming if you were the author of the code?
