## What is a Kata?

Wait... what does this have to do with the bootcamp?

In programming, we use Katas to practice different programming patterns in the same way that martial artists do, through constant repetition and practice. We want to make most of these patterns almost second nature so we can think about the larger problem instead of trying to get the code to do what we want.

We will be completing a series of exercises, or katas, that will allow us to continue to build on our programming skills. Be sure to create a new file for each kata.
