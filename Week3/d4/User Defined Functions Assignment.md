> #### Reflection Opportunity
> 
> After completing the activity, review your own code. Do your functions return the correct answers? Have you given your functions clear and concise names? Have you written your functions in a way that is clear? Implementing best practices at this stage in your learning journey will help solidify them as part of your coding process. Take the time now to review your code and see how you have already implemented best practices, and where you could tweak your code accordingly.
