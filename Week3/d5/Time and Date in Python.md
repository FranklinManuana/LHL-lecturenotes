When manipulating data in Python, we often need to work with date or time. This is even more true for data scientists because we can find some kind of a timestamp in almost every table.

### Datetime

As we already know, Python is great because it offers additional libraries to handle many things and time and date are no exception. It's nice to have access to a library that can handle this type of data. The most popular option in Python is the `datetime` module.

### Key Takeaways

Dates and times are often challenging aspects of programming. Time zones, adding and subtracting time, and mixing timestamps, string data and actual datetime data types can make it difficult to keep track of time accurately. This can be a problem when processing and manipulating data.

There are a few ways to deal with this issue. One is to use the `datetime` module. It handles date and time calculations. This can take care of many of the complexities for you.
