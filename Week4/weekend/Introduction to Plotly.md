In this activity, we will continue exploring data visualization libraries in `Python`. We will take a look at one of our favourite libraries called `Plotly`.

## What is Plotly?

_Plotly_ is a modern platform for data visualization, useful for producing a variety of plots, especially for data science. _Plotly_ is available as a library for Python, R, JavaScript, Julia, and MATLAB. It can also be used as a web application with these languages.

Instruction

Follow the instructions from [the **installation** section](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/#installation) to install the package.

Warning

We need to make sure to install Jupyterlab (notebook) extensions to work with Plotly.

- for [jupyter lab](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/#jupyterlab-support)
- for [jupyter notebook](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/#jupyter-notebook-support)

Don't worry about the other platforms in this article for now, but you can look at the example code to get a sense for how Plotly objects work.

If you feel that the object structure of `Plotly` graphs is a bit unclear, follow [this article](https://plotly.com/python/figure-structure/) for another view of it. We'll also explore it further in the walkthrough to follow.
