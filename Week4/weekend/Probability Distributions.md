This reading covers the intuition behind **probability distributions** and introduces some of the most frequently used distributions in statistics.

_A probability distribution_ is a function that describes the likelihood of obtaining the possible values that a random variable can assume. In other words, the values of the variable vary based on the underlying _probability distribution_.

Suppose we draw a random sample of people and measure the heights of the subjects. As we measure heights, we can create a _distribution_ of heights. This type of _distribution_ is useful when we need to know which outcomes are most likely, the spread of potential values, and the likelihood of different results.

Note

Statisticians use the following notation to describe probabilities: **P**(x) = the likelihood that the random variable takes a specific value of _x_.

The sum of all probabilities for all possible values must equal 1. Furthermore, the probability for a particular value or range of values must be between 0 and 1.

_Probability distributions_ describe the dispersion of the values of a random variable. Consequently, the kind of variable determines the type of _probability distribution_. For a single random variable, statisticians divide distributions into the following two types:

- **Probability mass functions** for discrete variables
- **Probability density functions** for continuous variables

By far, the most important probability distribution is **Normal distribution**. We will work with it all the time.

There are **many more** interesting distributions we will come across in our career. We can see the overview in the article below.

Here's quite an exhaustive article about [common statistical distributions](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/6-probability-distributions-data-science/). It serves just as an overview to get the idea of the distributions that exist. You **DON'T** need to remember the details.
