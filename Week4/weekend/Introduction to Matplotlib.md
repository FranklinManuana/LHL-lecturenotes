It's time to learn about the `Python` DataViz tools one by one, starting with the `Matplotlib` library.

## What Is Matplotlib?

_Matplotlib_ is one of the most popular Python packages used for data visualization. It is a cross-platform library for making 2D plots from data in arrays. It can be used in Python and IPython shells, Jupyter notebook, and also web application servers.

There are two possible approaches for creating Plots with Matplotlib:

1. Functional Approach (or stateful)
2. Object-Oriented Approach (or stateless)

Instruction
