Now that we have explored the plotting library `Matplotlib`, it's time to broaden our `Python` plotting portfolio with the `Seaborn` library. In this introductory activity, we will learn how to create some interesting charts which are not available in `Matplotlib`. We will also see how easy it is to create a complex chart with this library.

### What Is Seaborn?

Seaborn is a `Python` data visualization library based on `Matplotlib`. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
