In this activity, we are going to continue with our practice of using the `Plotly` package.

Instruction

Use [this repository](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/dataviz_exercises.git) and follow the instructions in the `plotly_exercise.ipynb` notebook.

## Conclusion

We have covered the three basic packages for visualizations in Python:

- Matplotlib,
- Seaborn,
- and Plotly.

We know the pros and cons of different libraries and we will be able to choose the right package for our future tasks.
