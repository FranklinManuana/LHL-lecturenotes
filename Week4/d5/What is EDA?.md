Exploratory data analysis (EDA) involves using graphics and visualizations to explore and analyze a dataset. The goal is to explore, investigate, and learn, as opposed to confirming statistical hypotheses.

### When Do You Need EDA?

Exploratory data analysis is a powerful way to explore a dataset. Even when your goal is to perform planned analyses, EDA can be used for data cleaning, subgroup analyses or simply for understanding your data better.

### The Data Analysis Process

The data analysis process is composed of these steps:

The data analysis process, or alternately, data analysis steps, involves gathering all the information, processing it, exploring the data, and using it to find patterns and other insights.

More specifically, the process consists of:

- **Identifying the problem to be solved by the analysis**: Ask yourself why you’re doing this analysis, what type of data analysis you want to use, and what data you are planning on analyzing.
- **Collecting the data**: Guided by the requirements you’ve identified, it’s time to collect the data from your sources. Sources include case studies, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, direct observation, and focus groups. Make sure to organize the collected data for analysis.
- **Cleaning the data**: Not all of the data you collect will be useful, so it’s time to clean it up. This step is where you remove white spaces, duplicate records, and basic errors. Data cleaning is mandatory before moving on to analysis.
- **Analyzing the data**: Here is where you use data analysis software and other tools to help you interpret and understand the data and arrive at conclusions.
- **Interpreting and visualizing data**: Now that you have your results, you need to interpret them and come up with the best courses of action, based on your findings. [Data visualization](https://www.simplilearn.com/data-visualization-article) is a fancy way of saying, “graphically show your information in a way that people can read and understand it.” You can use charts, graphs, maps, bullet points, or a host of other methods. Visualization helps you derive valuable insights by helping you compare datasets and observe relationships.

Remember, the data analysis process is iterative in nature!

### The EDA Process

The process of using numerical summaries and visualizations to explore your data and identify potential relationships between variables is called exploratory data analysis, or EDA.

EDA is an investigative process in which you use summary statistics and graphical tools to get to know your data and understand what you can learn from them.

With EDA, you can find anomalies in your data, such as outliers or unusual observations, uncover patterns, understand potential relationships among variables, and generate interesting questions or hypotheses that you can test later using more formal statistical methods.

Exploratory data analysis is like detective work: you're searching for clues and insights that can lead to the identification of potential root causes of the problem you are trying to solve. You explore one variable at a time, then two variables at a time, and then many variables at a time.

Although EDA encompasses tables of summary statistics such as the mean and standard deviation, most people focus on graphs. You use a [variety of graphs](https://www.jmp.com/en_hk/statistics-knowledge-portal/exploratory-data-analysis/types-of-graphs.html) and exploratory tools, and you go where your data take you. If one graph or analysis isn't informative, you look at the data from another perspective.

Because EDA involves exploring, it is iterative. You are likely to learn about different aspects of your data from different graphs.

Typical goals of EDA include understanding:

- the distribution of variables in your dataset. That is, what is the [shape of your data](https://www.jmp.com/en_hk/statistics-knowledge-portal/exploratory-data-analysis/histogram.html)? Is the distribution normal? Does it have a fat tail? Is it skewed? Is it bimodal?
- [the relationship between variables](https://www.jmp.com/en_hk/statistics-knowledge-portal/exploratory-data-analysis/scatter-plot.html)
- whether or not your data have outliers or unusual points. This may indicate data quality issues or lead to interesting insights.
- whether or not your data have [patterns over time](https://www.jmp.com/en_hk/statistics-knowledge-portal/exploratory-data-analysis/line-graph.html).

## Conclusion

EDA is a key process and should not be skipped. Many insights, patterns, and initial hypotheses can be formed through a thorough EDA process.
