If you feel like we have used _HTTP requests_ a couple of times already throughout previous activities, you are absolutely right. We have been using them to ask for information through different APIs. We've sent requests from Postman, Terminal, and Web Browser, too. Right now, we are going to drill down a bit into what the requests are, what types there are, and how we use them in APIs.

### Key Takeaways

To communicate through the internet efficiently, we use protocols, a set of rules and standards used by computers to communicate with each other. These protocols are all within the Internet protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model.

This communication starts with an HTTP request made by a client, to a named host located on a server. The aim of the request is to access a resource on the server.

To make the request, the client uses components of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which includes the information needed to access the resource.

A correctly composed HTTP request contains the following elements:

- A request line.
- A series of HTTP headers, or header fields.
- A message body, if needed.
