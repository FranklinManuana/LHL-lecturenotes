In this activity, we will learn about `data exploration`. It is an important part of _data preparation_ and often gives us the first glance at what is important in our data and what is garbage.

Data Exploration consists of the following parts:

1. Univariate exploration - exploring one variable at a time:
    - Explanatory variables (variables we will use for modeling)
    - Target variable (if applicable)
2. Multivariate exploration - exploring more than one variable at the same time:
    - Manual – using domain knowledge
    - Automatic – using Math
