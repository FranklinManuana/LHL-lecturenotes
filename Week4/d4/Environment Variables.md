At this point, we know that virtual environments are important and we know how to manage them. Before we will install different environments on our computers, let's learn about **environment variables**. This will help us understand how our computer knows which version of Python in which environment to run.

Even though the environment variables have a same purpose in all systems we work with them slightly differently so we divided the following content into two sections:

1. For Windows users
2. For Linux and Mac users.

### Windows

Instruction

Follow the article [**About Environment Variables**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables?view=powershell-7.1) in official Windows documentation. Focus on following sections:

- Long Description
- Using and changing environment variables
- Saving changes to environment variables

### Linux and Mac

Instruction

Follow the article [**What are environment variables in Bash?**](https://opensource.com/article/19/8/what-are-environment-variables) to find out about what they are. Also try the basics hands-on: open the terminal on your computer and follow the commands from the article.

Warning

At some points, the article refers to file `~/.bashrc`. This file is only in `Linux` systems. For some insight into the difference between `~/.bashrc` and `~/.bash_profile`, check out this [thread](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/51036/what-is-the-difference-between-bash-profile-and-bashrc).

## Conclusion

Environment variables can allow for easier configuration, better security and fewer production mistakes.
