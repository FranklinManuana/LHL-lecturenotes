The goal of this activity is to register for **Foursquare Places API** and obtain `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

_Foursquare Places API_ enables location discovery, venue search, and more directly from our program or application.

Instruction

Create a free account for the [**Foursquare API**](https://foursquare.com/developers/login?continue=%2Fdevelopers%2Fprojects).

Once you are logged in you will see a home page similar to this:

We will need to create our own _Project_ in order to use the API. We can start by clicking **Create New Project**.

Once clicked, we need to fill in name of the project.

When we do this our project will be created and we will be able to find **Client ID** and **Client Secret** there. In the last step, we have to generate our **API Key** because that will be used to authenticate us when we use the api.

Warning

Make sure to copy and store your API key because we will not be able to see it again the Foursquare user interface.

We will be using this API key as our unique identificator when using Foursquare Places API during the bootcamp. For more information about how to set up your account you can visit [the official documentation](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api-getting-started).
