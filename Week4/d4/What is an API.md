The first thing we need to know is: _APIs_ are everywhere!

_API_ is short for _Application Programming Interface_. _APIs_ allow 2 computers to communicate with each other and exchange information. They are used widely in data science and we will see some specific use-cases in this activity.

> #### Reflection Opportunity
> 
> Whenever you handle data, you need to be cognizant of data ethics. The principles of data ethics are crucial for ensuring that technology and data are used in a responsible and ethical manner and that the rights and interests of individuals are protected.
> 
> Data ethics with respect to API calls refers to the ethical principles and considerations that govern the use of APIs in handling data. This includes issues such as privacy, security, accuracy, transparency, accountability, and fairness.
> 
> For example, from the perspective of the users of API, when making API calls, it's important to ensure that data is collected, stored, and used in a way that respects the individual's privacy rights, such as obtaining proper consent, anonymizing data if necessary, and implementing proper security measures to prevent unauthorized access. From the perspective of API providers, it is important to ensure that the data returned from an API is accurate, transparent, and not biased in any way.
