We are going to look at JSON and XML together. It is important to know how they are similar and how they are different as well as the pros and cons of each.

### Key Takeaways

Key Comparison of JSON and XML:

- JSON’s data structure is a map (key-value pairs). XML’s data structure is a tree.
    
- JSON is simpler than XML, but XML is more powerful. For common applications, JSON's terse semantics result in code that is easier to follow. For applications with complex requirements surrounding data interchange, such as in enterprises, the powerful features of XML can significantly reduce software risk.
    
- JSON is a data interchange format and only provides a data encoding specification. XML is a language to specify custom markup languages and provides a lot more than data interchange. With its strict semantics, XML defined a standard to assert data integrity of XML documents, of any XML sub-language.
    
- JSON is best for simple applications, developed to satisfy simple requirements surrounding data interchange. XML is best for applications with complex requirements surrounding data interchange, such as in enterprises.
    
- JSON is faster because it is designed specifically for data interchange. JSON encoding is terse, which requires fewer bytes for transit. JSON parsers are less complex, which requires less processing time and memory overhead. XML is slower because it is designed for a lot more than just data interchange.
