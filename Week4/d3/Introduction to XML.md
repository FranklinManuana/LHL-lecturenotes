We will now learn about a new data type: `XML`, what it looks like and what the advantages of using it are.

`XML` is short for Extensible Markup Language and is used to describe data. The `XML` standard is a flexible way to create information formats and electronically share structured data.

Even though it is slowly being replaced by `JSON`, it is one of the fundamental data formats and it's crucial to learn about it.

### Key Takeaways

Here are some important characteristics of XML:

- XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language similar to HTML, but without predefined tags to use. Instead, you define your own tags designed specifically for your needs.
- XML is a powerful way to store data in a format that can be stored, searched, and shared.
- The whole structure of XML and XML-based languages is built on tags. The tags should be self-explanatory to readers, in the sense that the tag names used should reflect the information contained inside the tag.
- Most importantly, since the fundamental format of XML is standardized, if you share or transmit XML across systems or platforms, either locally or over the internet, the recipient can still parse the data due to the standardized XML syntax.
