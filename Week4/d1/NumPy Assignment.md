## NumPy

Now that we are familiar with the data type `np.array`, we can work in Python much more efficiently as Python works more efficiently and faster with this data type.

Instruction

Download [this Jupyter notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10-YHmcxt0KbKZV4Aio1Df2gcDm3aj9U4/view?usp=sharing) and follow the instructions.

Note

In spite of all the benefits `np.array` brings, we shouldn't forget the other data types since we cannot use `np.array` all the time. We will see that sometimes it's more efficient to use `list` or `dictionary`, for example, if we want to iterate over the values in a variable.
