## Final Project Planning  
Refer to **`DS_Final_Project_Planning.md`** for:  
- Project idea brainstorming  
- Problem statement, success metrics  
- Data-source inventory, constraints & assumptions

## How to Use These Notes  
1. Pick the week you want to review and open the corresponding folder.  
2. Read through the notebook(s) or markdown files in that folder—they reflect the lecture and lab for that week.  
3. Use them as templates: copy a notebook into a new project, adapt the dataset, and explore.  
4. Keep this repo updated as you continue learning or add your own commentary, corrections, or extensions.
