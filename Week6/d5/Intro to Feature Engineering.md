We are more likely to come up with a great feature set rather than invent a new ML algorithm. Therefore, it's very important to spend some quality time on the phase of Machine Learning called **Feature Engineering**.

## Feature Engineering

_Feature engineering_ is a required part of training ML models. Feature engineering is the process of choosing, adapting and transforming raw data into features. The features can be used in supervised and unsupervised learning models to help us classify data quickly and train the model.

Remember that a feature is an input that can be used in a predictive model. In feature engineering, we use statistical and machine learning approaches to design and train desired features from raw data. A good feature helps us to improve our model’s accuracy

To choose a good feature to add to our model, we need to start with our intuition and verify it by testing over time.

In some cases, _data preparation_ can be considered as the first step in feature engineering so in some articles and resources online, you will find these two topics listed together.
