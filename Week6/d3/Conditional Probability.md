## Conditional Probability

In this activity, we will focus on understanding **conditional probability**. We will also compare this probability with **marginal** and **joint** probabilities.

### What is Conditional Probability?

_Conditional probability_ is defined as the likelihood of an event or an outcome occurring, based on the occurrence of a previous event or outcome. _Conditional probability_ is calculated by multiplying the probability of the preceding event by the updated probability of the succeeding, or conditional, event.

Note

_Conditional probability_ of **A** given **B** is denoted as **P(A|B)**.

### Conditional Probability vs. Joint Probability and Marginal Probability

We are going to look at all three probabilities to make sure that we don’t confuse them.

`Conditional probability:` **P(A|B)** is the probability of an event **A** occurring, given that an event **B** occurs.

_Example:_ Given that you have drawn a red playing card, what is the probability that it is a four? Out of the 26 red cards in a deck, there are two fours so **P(four|red)**=2/26=1/13.

`Marginal probability:` The probability of an event occurring **P(A)** . We can think of it as an unconditional probability. It is not conditioned by another event.

_Example:_ The probability that a drawn card is red **P(red)** = 0.5.

`Joint probability:` **P(A and B)**. The probability of both an event **A** and an event **B** occurring. It is the probability of the intersection of two or more events. The probability of the intersection of **A** and **B** may be written **P(A ∩ B)**.

_Example:_ What is the probability that a drawn card is a red four? There are two red fours in a deck of 52, the 4 of hearts and the 4 of diamonds, therefore **P(four and red)** = 2/52=1/26.
