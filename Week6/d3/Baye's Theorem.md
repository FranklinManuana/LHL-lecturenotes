In this activity, we will focus on **Bayes' Theorem**, which is based on conditional probability. It is important for us because many modern machine learning techniques rely on it. For instance, spam filters use Bayesian updating to determine whether an email is genuine or spam based on the words contained in the email.

### What is Bayes' Theorem?

In statistics and probability theory, _Bayes' Theorem_, also known as _the Bayes' rule_, is a mathematical formula used to determine the conditional probability of events. Essentially, it describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of the conditions that might be relevant to the event.

The theorem is named after Thomas Bayes, an English statistician who discovered the formula in 1763. It is considered the foundation of a special statistical inference approach called the Bayes' inference.

Besides statistics, _the Bayes' theorem_ is used in various other disciplines: most notably in medicine and pharmacology but also in different fields of finance. Some of them model the risk of lending money to borrowers or forecast the probability of success of an investment.
