In this activity, we will focus on two must-know statistical concepts: **the Law of Large Numbers** and **the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**.

### The Law of Large Numbers

In statistics and probability theory, _the law of large numbers_ is a theorem that describes the result of repeating the same experiment a large number of times. _The large numbers theorem_ states that if the same experiment or study is repeated independently a large number of times, the average of the results of the trials must be close to **the expected value**. The result becomes closer to _the expected value_ as the number of trials increases.

_The law of large numbers_ is an important concept in statistics because it states that even random events with a large number of trials may return stable long-term results.

Note

_The large numbers theorem_ deals only with a large number of trials, while the average of the results of an experiment repeated a small number of times might be substantially different from _the expected value_. However, each additional trial increases the precision of the average result.

`Example:` The simplest example of _the law of large numbers_ is rolling a dice, which involves six different events with equal probabilities of occurrence. If we roll the dice only three times, the average of the obtained results may be far from _the expected value_. Let’s say we rolled the dice three times and the outcomes were 6, 6, and 3. The average of the results is 5. According to _the law of large numbers_, if we roll the dice a large number of times, the average result will be close to _the expected value_ of 3.5.

### Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

The essential concept of _the central limit theorem_ is that the average of our samples' means will be the population mean. In other words, if we add up the means from all of our samples and find the average, that average will be our actual population mean. Similarly, if we find the average of the standard deviations of our samples, we will find the actual standard deviation for our population. It is a pretty useful phenomenon that can help us accurately predict the characteristics of a population.
