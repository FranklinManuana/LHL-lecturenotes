## Probability and Statistics: Terminology

This activity covers the basic terminology of **statistics** and **probability theory**. It is important to learn these concepts now because they will be recurring in our future readings.

### What is the Probability Theory?

_Probability theory_ is a branch of mathematics concerned with _probability_. Although there are several different _probability_ interpretations, _probability theory_ treats the concept in a rigorous mathematical manner by expressing it through a set of axioms.

### What is Statistics?

_Statistics_ is a subfield of mathematics. It refers to a collection of methods for working with data and using data to answer questions. We need _statistics_ to help us turn observations into information and to answer questions about samples of observations.

_Probability_ deals with predicting the likelihood of future events, while _statistics_ involves the analysis of the frequency of past events.
