In the context of industry applications of machine learning, we can classify applications as external or internal use cases based on the nature of their business impact.

### External Use Cases

In external use cases, the goal of the machine learning tool is to provide or directly improve the service to end users. For example:

#### Recommendation Systems

Recommendation Systems is a composite term used to describe algorithms that take the following 3 items as input:

1. historical data of the individual user to learn about their preferences
2. data of other users to learn about patterns in preferences
3. features of the products offered by the company

An algorithm then leverages this data to predict and suggest newer products for the individual based on the assumption that their individual likes are similar to other people who share similar historical preferences. Companies associated with media content, like Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube have the most complex recommendation algorithms. Recommendation algorithms are also gaining traction on e-commerce platforms as more and more data is collected on customers and methods of customer segmentation are improved.

#### Smart Home Heating and Cooling

IoT(Internet of Things) sensors installed at homes and cars have been leveraged by machine learning algorithms that learn how to optimally control the heating and cooling cycles in a home. The goal is to keep your home at the right temperature for when you return home from work. The Nest Thermostat is a great example of such a product.

#### Internal Use Cases

Herein the insights gained from machine learning models are used internally by the company to gain insights that improve its internal business operations.

#### Demand Forecasting

Many machine learning algorithms, ranging from neural networks called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to linear regression-based Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, are used to predict the value of a variable at a future point in time. These models take as inputs the historical value of the variable that is to be predicted as well as the historical data of other variables that have an impact on the variable of interest. A significant application of these models is to predict and forecast the future demand for their product or service. The insight from these models can help the company plan their supply chain operations for sourcing raw materials, retail and warehousing logistics as well as create projections for profits and losses for investors.

#### Loan Default Detection

Due to increasing digitization, computational ability, and ease of storage there has been a boom in the collection of customer data. Companies use a variety of techniques to segregate their customers into groups that are likely to behave similarly (customer segmentation) in order to predict customer behaviour.

The data collected from customers can range from their demographics to their clickstream activity on an app or website. In the context of banks, data collected includes their life events and financial history. If big data can be used to identify similar people and their behavioural patterns can be measured then ideally, one can predict the behaviour of a single individual by looking at the historical record of a similar person. An important area of application for customer segmentation and prediction is detecting the financial ability to repay loan sums, or create a metric that quantifies the risk associated with an individual for the purpose of offering insurance products.

#### Predictive Maintenance with IoT

The proliferation of IoT in industries has led to a variety of sensors being deployed on machines with real-time communication and tracking. Machine-learning algorithms can be employed to “learn” the normal operating conditions of these complex systems and used to predict when it starts to malfunction.

#### Fraud Detection

In recent years, rising financial transactions over the internet as well as customer desires for banking ease have led to an increase in risks around fraudulent bank activity and transactions. Special machine learning algorithms that can operate on very large volumes of data in a very short period of time have been developed to earmark and stop illegal transactions.

While this appears to be a standard classification task, a major issue in training machine learning models for this application is the large class imbalance in the data, that is, massive numbers of transactions are regular and kosher and very few of them are fraudulent. This makes the fraud detection problem truly challenging.
