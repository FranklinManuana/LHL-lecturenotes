## Introduction to the ML process

The typical Machine Learning process consists of the following steps: - Gathering data - Data preparation - Model selection - Training and Evaluation (hyperparameter tuning) - Prediction and Deployment

We've already covered parts of **Data Gathering** like APIs or scraping. Data can come also in many different formats or from a company database through various tables.

We will go through the rest of the steps later. For now, we're starting with an introductory article (or a video) about this flow.

Instruction

We will get familiar with the steps above by reading [The 7 Steps of Machine Learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NN4Z3vWpv_uyVAasovzK3rNUUsfndDlz/view?usp=drive_link) from Towards Data Science. If you prefer to watch a video instead you can continue to the video below:
