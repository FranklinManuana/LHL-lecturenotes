Machine learning (ML) is a rapidly growing field that has captured the interest of the global community. In the article “[Machine learning, explained](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained)”, MIT defines ML in the following way:

**_“Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behaviour. Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems."_**

The goal of AI is to create computer models that exhibit “intelligent behaviors” like humans, according to Boris Katz, a principal research scientist and head of the InfoLab Group at CSAIL. This means machines that can recognize a visual scene, understand a text written in natural language, or perform an action in the physical world.

ML is one way to use AI. It was defined in the 1950s by AI pioneer Arthur Samuel as “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.”

In this course, you will gain an overview of ML and its applications in data science. By the end of this unit, you will be able to do the following: * Describe the motivations surrounding ML and types of problems that are of interest * Identify the fundamental concepts that underlie ML * Recognize the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning * Recall key current use cases of ML * Describe the strengths and limitations of ML * Recognize how to handle and clean datasets for ML * Recall a typical Machine learning workflow

By exploring these items, you will gain a clearer picture of what ML is.
