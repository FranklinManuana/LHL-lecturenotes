In this unit, you recognized the importance of machine learning for modern businesses and discussed briefly the range of problems and applications machine learning can be used to tackle.

Broadly, there are four distinct types of machine learning tasks: 1. supervised learning, 2. unsupervised learning, 3. semi-supervised learning and 4. reinforcement learning.

We explored each of these types. In this course, henceforth, we will be mainly focusing our attention on the two dominant paradigms of supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

Measuring the performance of machine learning models and understanding how to evaluate them is a key step in building reliable predictions and insights.

Given that there exist multiple algorithms capable of performing a particular task, it is crucial to determine the optimal model and its corresponding parameters that can effectively identify patterns in the dataset..

Machine learning, however, is not a magic bullet. It is key to understand its strengths and limitations for a successful implementation.
