### So what is machine learning?

Machine learning refers, in general, to algorithms that use statistical reasoning to find patterns within massive amounts of data.

Data can mean a lot of things and can take many forms. Quantitative, i.e., numerical data is the most common. However, increasingly, data can be in the form of images, text, or speech. If it can be digitally stored, then it can be fed into a machine-learning algorithm. The big data revolution allows businesses to store, process, and extract useful information from datasets that are far too complex and large for traditional data processing methods.

While artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning are often used interchangeably, there are key differences between the three.

AI refers to the grand goal of developing machines that can mimic human behaviour and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, whereas ML refers to the much humbler task of simply using algorithms to learn from data. Many of the recent breakthroughs in AI, such as deep learning, have been driven by advances in machine learning algorithms and techniques.

Deep learning, on the other hand, refers to a specific advanced machine learning technique employing artificial neural networks which attempts to mimic how a human brain learns.

### Why should we understand machine learning?

Machine learning has tremendous potential to transform companies, but in practice, it’s not a magic bullet.

People who want to get the most out of their companies’ data should understand what ML is, what it can do, and what its limitations are.

While there are many successful implementations of ML projects adding value to companies, there are several examples of failures of AI/ML projects.

Some notable failures of ML implementations include:

- In 2013, IBM partnered with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The goal? To cure cancer using IBM’s Watson. But it very soon ran into major problems. Doctors identified several examples of incorrect and sometimes downright lethal treatment recommendations. MD Anderson cancelled the project in 2016 – but not before spending US $62 million.
- In 2016, Microsoft unveiled a new AI chatbot Tay on Twitter that interacted with users and learned from these conversations. But it quickly turned into a public relations disaster. In less than a day, trolls had corrupted Tay’s ML algorithm to spew inflammatory and offensive tweets. Microsoft had to pull the bot.

These failures are not deficiencies in the machine learning algorithms used, but rather a complete failure of the systems, people and organisations that built these systems — a failure by the decision makers to understand what machine learning is, what machine learning can do, and what it cannot.

This underscores the importance of ML training for data scientists.

### So what is not considered machine learning?

#### Rule-based methods are not machine learning

A rule-based algorithm using rules that are hard-coded in the form of if-then-else statements does not constitute machine learning. Rule-based algorithms use the knowledge of a human expert in a specialised domain and capture it within an algorithm to automate. No more, no less. There is no ‘learning’ by an algorithm here and so, it is not machine learning. In machine learning, "learning" refers to the process of training an algorithm or model to make predictions or decisions based on data. The goal of machine learning is to develop algorithms that can automatically learn patterns and relationships in data, and use this knowledge to make accurate predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. For certain well-understood problems, rule-based algorithms may be the preferable approach.

#### Descriptive data analytics is not machine learning.

Most organizations that employ analytics begin from the hindsight stage where data is used onlyto describe the past. Tracking the largest buyers from the organization, ranking the reliability of suppliers etc. all fall under this category of describing the past with data.

This is not machine learning since there is no insight being gained beyond representing data visually for easy understanding and communication – this is descriptive data analytics.

As an organization matures, it progresses into the insight (making sense of data), and foresight (dynamically preparing for the future based on those insights) stages.

Machine learning algorithms play a role in these two later stages of prescriptive data analytics.
