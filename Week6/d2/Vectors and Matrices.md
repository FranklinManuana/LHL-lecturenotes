## Vectors and Matrices

In this activity, we will take a look at two concepts essential for data science and machine learning: **vectors** and **matrices**.

### What is a Vector?

We can think of a _vector_ as an array of **ordered** elements called _components_.

It is typically represented by a lowercase bold letter such as **v**. The individual components of _a vector_ are denoted by the vector name with a subscript indicating their position. For example, v1 is the first component, v2 is the second component, and so on. If we want to represent _a vector_ with its explicit components, then we enclose the individual components in brackets.

### What is a Matrix?

_A matrix_ is a two-dimensional array of elements. Generally, _a matrix_ is represented by an uppercase bold letter such as **A**. Since _a matrix_ is two-dimensional, each element is represented by a lowercase letter with two indices such as aij where _i_ represents the row and _j_ represents the column.
