"_Linear algebra_ is a branch of mathematics, but the truth of it is that _linear algebra_ is the mathematics of data. Matrices and vectors are the language of data." (J. Brownlee, 2018)

_Linear algebra_ is about linear combinations. That means using arithmetic on columns of numbers called **vectors** and arrays of numbers called **matrices**, to create new columns and arrays of numbers. _Linear algebra_ is the study of lines and planes, vector spaces, and mappings that are necessary for linear transformations.
