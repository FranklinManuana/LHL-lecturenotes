## Basic Operations with Matrices

Now that we've defined vectors and matrices, we will look at the various operations that can be done with them.

Instruction

Take a look at the [Basic Matrix Operations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RkRTASin_SCEQyWVNxytnB4VL8ryHX9z/view?usp=sharing), i.e. **matrix addition** and **multiplication**, to get the basic intuition for how they work.

Warning

Pay attention to which types of objects (vectors, matrices, or scalars) each operation applies to and what type of object each operation produces.

Note

We can consider a vector **v** with _x_ coordinates (**v**=[v1,v2,...,vx]T ) as a matrix **M** with _x_ rows and 1 column. This allows us to only focus on matrix operations.

Instruction

To learn more about operations with matrices, read the [Introduction to Matrix Algebra I & II](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WmHZfacI4Ew0n5jZkEjpnlxuArTNsiPo/view?usp=sharing). For a more visual explanation of some of these concepts, check out the [3Blue1Brown Playlist on Linear Algebra](https://youtu.be/kjBOesZCoqc)

The above resources cover operations with matrices in a great detail. These are the concepts we need to primarily focus on:

- _inner product (dot product)_
- _matrix addition, subtraction, and their properties_
- _matrix multiplications and their properties_
- _square matrices_
- _matrix transposition_
- _symmetric matrices_
- _identity matrices_
- _determinants_
- _minors (or sometimes called cofactors)_
- _adjoint matrices_
- _inverse matrices_
- _rank_

Note

Don't worry if you are having a hard time to understand all of the concepts. Consider returning to this activity when you come across a specific matrix operation or terminology in an activity, as the context of the activity may help you better understand the concept.
